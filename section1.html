        <h1>Lever</h1>

        <br>
        A lever consists of a beam fixed on a fulcrum.
         They can be used to exert a large force 
         (resistance) over a small distance on one 
         end by exerting a small force (effort) over 
         a larger distance on the other end, thereby 
         creating mechanical advantage by trading off 
         force against movement.
          Archeological evidence suggests that levers 
          have been in use as early as 5000 BC. 
          There are three classes of levers distinguished
           by the relative positions of the fulcrum, effort, 
           and resistance. 
    </div>
    <h2>Classification of Levers</h2>
<p>These are the types of levers. They differ by 
    whether the fulcrum, effort, or resistance
    is in the middle (between the other two).
    The following
    table will list the classes of levers and 
    the relative positions of the effort, resistance,
    and fulcrum.
