        <h1>Wheel and axle</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        A wheel and axle consists of a larger cyliner (wheel) mounted on another cocentric 
        cylinder with a smaller diameter (axle). The two parts are able to revolve around the same axis. 
        Mechanical advantage is achieved by applying a tangential force to the wheel, 
        enabling a larger force to be exerted upon a load attached to the axle. 
        One of the earliest known applications of the wheel and axle is the potters wheel, 
        in use in the Middle East since approximately 5000 BC.
